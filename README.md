[![Gitpod ready-to-code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-ready--to--code-blue?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/fedtools/federation-defaults)

A collection of federation defaults for optimal handling of R&E federation aggregates and trust models.


Missing settings for your federation? Contact your federation operator via  their [eduGAIN contact](https://technical.edugain.org/status) to have them get added here by forking the repo and mapping the federation into the eduGAIN shortname like the others and then submit a pull request to be added.
